        <strong>IMPORTANT TERMS ABOUT THIS CONTRACT</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Please take a few minutes to read the following important terms. Further terms and conditions are set out later in this Contract which you should also read
        Carefully. Part 1 of this contract sets out the terms that apply to your use of Sky Go. Part 2 of this Contract includes additional terms that apply to Sky.
        TV customers who take a Sky Go Extra subscription.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Can I subscribe to the Service?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Yes, if you are 18 or over and you use the Service only on your Device(s) in the Territory (defined below). Sky Go Extra is only available to Sky TV customers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How much does the Service cost and how do I pay for it?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are a Sky TV customer access to some Content is available at no extra charge. To access some Service features and Content you may need to pay a
        Subscription Payment for Sky Go Extra. You can also separately purchase access to other Content. Non-Sky TV
        subscribers must pay a Subscription Payment to
        use the Service. Payments (where applicable) will be added to your Sky TV bill or processed separately on our behalf by MPP (depending on whether or not
        you are a Sky TV customer and the Content in question). Pricing information is displayed on the Website and/or within the Service at the point from which
        you can access Content.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What network connection do I need to access the Service?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Access to the Service is dependent on you having an adequate broadband internet connection (minimum 2Mbps recommended per Device accessing the service
        concurrently) and/or 3G Mobile Network (180-1400Kbps recommended depending on the Content you want to watch and the Device you are using). Further
        information on these requirements is set out on the Website.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What Content is available?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Content that is available on the Service depends on the part of the Service you are subscribing to and is set out on the Website and updated from time
        to time. Due to rights restrictions, we may be unable to make certain programmes available via the Service or we may be unable to show Content on certain
        Devices (see Website for details).
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Will the Service change?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The Service is variable and therefore may change from time to time, including the Content available on and the Devices compatible with the Service. (Some
        of the Content available on the Service is supplied by other broadcasters and therefore the availability of such Content is outside our control.)
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How much notice will I get if you change the Service or increase my Subscription Payment?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Other than for changes to the Content on the Service (which happen regularly and which we won&#8217;t normally notify you about), we will try to give you at least 31 days&#8217; notice before we change the Service to your material disadvantage (we may be unable to do so if, for example, a change is required for security reasons or because a third party broadcaster no longer makes Content or functionality available to us) or increase your Subscription Payment, unless such increase results from: (a) you changing your subscription; or (b) us being required to increase our prices by law or because a regulatory authority requests or requires us to do so (if this happens we will try to give you reasonable notice in writing). If you are not the payer of the Subscription Payment, you should tell the payer about any price increase notice we send you.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>How do special offers affect my Contract?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are eligible for and take up a special offer, the relevant terms and conditions in this Contract will be varied to take account of the offer terms
        and conditions.

        7.4.5 if you or anyone you authorise to deal with us on your behalf acts in a way towards our staff or agents which we reasonably consider to be

        <strong>12 VARIATIONS AND REVISIONS</strong>

Subject to clause 12.1a, we will use reasonable efforts to give you at least 31 days'; notice before we change the Service which is likely to be to your material disadvantage (we may be unable to do so if, for example, a change is required for security reasons or because a third party broadcaster no longer makes Content or functionality available to us) or increase your Subscription Payment, unless such increase results from: (a) you changing your subscription; or (b) us being required to increase our prices by law or because a regulatory authority requests us to do so or requires a change to any aspect of our pricing which directly affects your Subscription Payments or our pricing structure (if this happens we will try to give you reasonable notice). If you are not the payer of the Subscription Payment, you should tell the payer about any price increase notice we send you. 
    </p>

        terms and conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
        12.3 Unless the change is required to be made immediately for security, legal or regulatory reasons in which case we will notify you as soon as reasonably possible, you will receive at least 31 days'; notice of any changes to this Contract which are made for any reason stated in Condition 15.1 or 15.2. This right to vary will not be used to change the terms of any special offer which applies to you and you have accepted during the term of the offer.
    </p>
    <p>
        12.4 If we amend this Contract and you reasonably consider that you would be materially disadvantaged by this you may end this Contract by giving us 7
        days' notice ending no later than 31 days' from the date of the notice referred to in clause 12.3.
